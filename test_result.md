Theme dropdown opens correctly (6 theme options found), but onclick handlers are blocked by CSP 'script-src-attr none'. Theme does not change when clicking options. Current theme remains 'dark' even after clicking 'cyberpunk'. CSP needs to be updated to allow inline event handlers or theme switching needs to be refactored to use event listeners."
